	Big O Run Times
	----------------------------
	createDataSet() = O(n)
	destroyDataSet() = O(n)
	searchID() = O(1)
	insertion() = O(1)
	deletion() = O(1)
	
	My implementation used an array where the index is equal to the student ID for application 2,
	(also known as direct hashing). I felt this was easiest implementation as direct hashing is more 
	efficient if I am looking at a specific index that maps to a unqiue student ID.
